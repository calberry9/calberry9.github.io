            <p>Hello! My name is Callaghan Berry and this is my Personal Project Portfolio, (a project in and of itself). I created this website as a place to showcase some of my projects and serve as a digital resume, as well as learn some basic HTML and CSS. This website is a work in progress, so it may look a little rough around the edges, but if your seeing this, it works!</p>
            <p>A bit about me, I graduated from Tufts University with my degreee in Electrical Engineering in May of 2023. Since then, I have been working at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory as an Assistant Staff - HF Radar Engineer. I am still in the process of discovering what I want to specialize in, but my current interests lie in the areas of Signal Processing, Communications, and RF Hardware Design.</p>
